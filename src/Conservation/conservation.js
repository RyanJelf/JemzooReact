                    <p>Conservation is what Jems Zoo is all about. We aim to make difference where it really will help the planet on itâ€™s conservation mission. Our Zoo is an environment that looks to show and demonstrate why this mission should be for everyone to undertake and we have ensured that the facilities we have are aligned with other institutions on this mission and are suitable for each of the different species we are looking to protect from simulating natural habitats to training keepers who create a special bond with the animals to ensure we can monitor their health and needs as closely as possible. </p>
